# DOF Build Setup

The build is set up for Visual Studio 2022.  To perform a build, start Visual
Studio, and load the DOF solution (.sln) file.  It should take care of the build
dependency ordering.

If you want to be able to build the MSI installer, a free third-party tool
called WiX Toolset is required, and must be installed manually.  The MSI
installer is the last build step, so if you don't want to bother with WiX, you
can still build everything else; just ignore the errors on the last step where
VS tries to build the MSI.

## Migrating to newer Visual Studio versions

Moving a project to a newer version of Visual Studio is usually pretty easy, but
be aware that a newer Visual Studio might prompt you to change project settings
to update build tool versions and/or .NET component versions.  If you accept
those changes, **they will modify the build** and therefore might make it harder
to merge your changes into other people's forks.

Updates to .NET components require careful consideration because of the effect
they can have on deployment compatibility.  Some people use DOF with older
Windows versions, so a .NET update that only works with Windows 11, say, would
lock out a lot of users.  The virtual pin cab community doesn't have any sort of
official support policy that says which versions of Windows are still supported -
we're just an informal coalition of open-source developers, after all - but we
generally try to keep supporting older systems for longer than Microsoft does.
So .NET updates from Microsoft might well exclude older systems that are still
important to pin cab users.

If you do feel that a build tool update or .NET component update is in order,
it's helpful to **create a pull request or commit just for the tooling
changes**.  That's useful because it makes it easy to test **just** the project
file changes, in case a new bug appears afterward.  If the project file
changes are mixed into the same commit with other changes, it's harder to
isolate whether the bug is coming from the tool updates or the actual code changes.


## WiX setup (optional - required only for .msi creation)

The WiX toolset requires installing two separate packages:

1\. Install the WiX command-line tools from the github release page:
[https://github.com/wixtoolset/wix3/releases](https://github.com/wixtoolset/wix3/releases).
Grab the .EXE for version **3.14.0**, which is a self-installer; run it and
you'll be set.  **WARNING: Do not install 3.14.1;** see below.

**Important:** As of this writing, you **MUST** use WiX version **3.14.0**.  I
can't tell you how much I hate it when open-source projects require installing
a specific out-of-date version of some tool; it's a sure sign that it's going to
be a nightmare to get the build working, and that probably even the original
developers aren't sure how the build really works.  So let me explain why I'm
asking the same thing, and why it's necessary in this case.  The DirectOutput
MSI builder is written in WiX v3, and Wix 3.14.0 is the last release on the WiX
v3 branch that works.  It's the last version of v3 that will **ever** work,
because the WiX developers have stated publicly that they've discontinued v3
work and will never release any more patches on that branch, *even though* the
final v3 release, 3.14.1, contains a known bug that makes it produce non-working
installs.  (Installs produced with 3.14.1 fail in a particularly spectacular
way, leaving your registry hosed and requiring manual cleanup.  Avoid at all
costs.)  WiX has moved on to v4 and v5, but those are thoroughly incompatible
with v3 scripts, requiring a substantial rewrite.  I've investigated doing that,
but decided that I'm not willing at this time because it's basically starting
from scratch, and the new WiX language is essentially undocumented.  It would be
a lot of work even if WiX v4/5 were documented, but the lack of documentation
makes it simply out of the question for me right now.  If anyone wants to
volunteer, though...

Note that the non-working WiX 3.14.1 contains fixes for two security
vulnerabilities that are considered severe enough that the WiX developers advise
against using any earlier version.  (They also don't expect you to use 3.14.1,
given the show-stopping new bug mentioned above; they seem to consider v3 as a
whole fully bricked at this point.)  After studying the release notes for the
3.14.1 security fixes, I concluded that the vulnerabilities don't affect the DOF
MSI, because they're only triggered when invoking specific commands that the DOF
MSI doesn't use.  So I consider 3.14.0 safe for DOF use.

2\. Install the WiX add-in tools for Visual Studio. This is done within Visual
Studio: on the main menu, select Extensions > Manage Extensions to bring up the
Extension Manager window.  Select the Browse tab in the window.  Type **Wix v3**
into the search box.  Find **Wix v3 - Visual Studio 2022 Extension** in the
result list.  Click the Install button.


## Build procedure

Build from the Visual Studio GUI as follows:

1. In the configuration selector in the main toolbar, select the **Debug** or
**Release** build as desired.  (Most past DOF releases were built in Debug mode.
This isn't a very professional practice, but it's well-intentioned, in the hope
of protecting users from any surprises from differences in behavior between the
Debug build, which is typically well tested in the sense that it's what the
developers have been routinely running as they worked on it, and the Release
build, which they typically haven't run much, if at all.  In an ideal world, the
Release build would work exactly like the Debug build, just being faster and
smaller, but compilers aren't always perfect at achieving identical behavior
across the two configurations.  An alternative ideal world would be one in which
DOF is well staffed with QA engineers who've thoroughly tested the Release
configuration, but that's another ideal that is not always realized in
practice.)

2. In the configuration selector, choose the desired build architecture, **x86** or **x64**.
Each must be built separately.  **Build x86 first, then x64** (see below).

3. On the main menu, Build > Clean Solution

4. On the main menu, Build > Build Solution

This should build all of the DOF binaries plus the .msi installers, depositing the target
files in various subfolders.

**The build order is important:** Build the **x86** version **first**, then
build the x64 version.  Due to limitations of the WiX tools, the WiX setup
builder for 64-bit has to read from some of the x86 target files, so they have
to exist before the x64 build will complete successfully.  It's a stupid and
fragile setup, I know, but I can't find any other workaround for the WiX issue.
And Visual Studio unfortunately doesn't have any way that I know of to carry
out the x86 and x64 builds in sequence, so you just have to know to run the
two builds manually in that order.


## Release process

The .msi files that come out of the Visual Studio build are complete,
stand-alone MS Setup release bundles, containing all of the necessary files to
perform a complete install.  These can be posted for download as-is.  A user
simply downloads the file and double-clicks it, which will launch MS Setup and
carry out the install.

In addition, you can build a ZIP file containing the install set, for people who
want to do the install by hand rather than using the .msi files.  The main
folder contains a script, **MakebinZip.bat**, that builds the .ZIP.  Run it
from a CMD window after completing the Visual Studio build.  You'll need a
command-line ZIP tool somewhere on your path, named ZIP.EXE.  The script
takes two arguments, selecting the binaries by the architecture and build 
configuration:

```
MakeZip x86 debug
MakeZip x86 release
MakeZip x64 debug
MakeZip x64 release
```

**If you're checking any changes into git,** always close Visual Studio before
doing your final commit.  Visual Studio sometimes postpones writing changes to
the project and solution files (among others) until you exit, no matter how many
times you hit Save All.
